"""Real tool-call-with-result tracking for AgentRunner-driven eval loops.

`cuga evaluate`'s own tool-call extraction (evaluate_cuga.py::parse_test_results)
reads "api_call" ActivityTracker steps -- CugaLite's fast-execution path (the
one actually used whenever the tool count is below
settings.shortlisting_tool_threshold, which is every case this mock exercises)
never emits steps named that way, so that extraction silently finds nothing,
even when the agent's calls genuinely succeeded. Confirmed directly: a call
that produced a real recorded success still showed up as
tool_call_mismatches: [{"type": "missing", "actual": null}].

AgentState's own `tool_calls` field (populated by ToolCallTracker) is the
reliable alternative -- it carries real name/arguments/result -- but only
accumulates when configurable["track_tool_calls"] is set, which no public
AgentRunner/AgentLoop entry point exposes -- so this monkeypatches AgentLoop
construction to inject it into every graph invocation's config.

extract_tool_calls_with_results() below is used for two things now: feeding
the agentic_quality judge (which only reads "result"), and (as of
evaluate_cuga.py's tool_call_score fix) rebuilding the actual ToolCall list
for tool_call_score's exact-match comparison, which needs "arguments" too.
