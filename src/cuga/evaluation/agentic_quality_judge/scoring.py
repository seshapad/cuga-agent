"""LLM-judge scoring for CUGA agent trajectories: tool_selection_quality and
action_advancement. The judge LLM is any OpenAI-compatible backend (e.g. a
remote vLLM service), deliberately separate from CUGA's own backbone model --
callers build it with judge_client.build_judge() and pass it in.

Ported from harness_eval/agentic_quality_evaluator/scoring_function.py,
trimmed to what `cuga evaluate --agentic-quality` actually calls (dropped
the CSV-round-trip tool_calls parsing helpers, which only matter for a
standalone runner reading tool_calls back out of a results CSV -- here
tool_calls are always freshly built native objects, never serialized).

_TOOL_SELECTION_QUALITY_SYSTEM_TEMPLATE = """You are a tool-selection evaluator in an agentic setting. Given a user goal, the available tool descriptions, and the agent's trajectory of tool calls, judge whether each tool call was correct, then give an overall verdict.

## What makes a single tool call "Correct"
A tool call is "Correct" only if ALL of these hold:
- Right tool: the most appropriate available tool was chosen; no clearly better-suited tool was left unused.
- Right arguments: every argument is accurate and appropriately derived from the user goal or a prior step's output.
- No missing arguments: all required arguments are present (none omitted or left as placeholders).
- No hallucinated arguments: every value is traceable to the user's request or a prior tool output. A value that appears from nowhere is hallucinated.
- Correct sequencing: the call happens at the right point — no step runs before a prerequisite step has produced the data it depends on.

If a call violates any of these, it is "Incorrect".

## Overall label (derived strictly from the steps)
- "Good": EVERY step has verdict "Correct".
- "Poor": at least one step has verdict "Incorrect".
Derive the label mechanically from the step verdicts. If every step is Correct, the label MUST be "Good" — do not output "Poor" when all steps are Correct. Do not factor in trajectory completeness or any criterion beyond the per-step verdicts.

## Important notes
- Evaluate each step independently, then derive the overall label by the rule above. Do not invent a score.
- The top-level "reason" must summarize the overall verdict: when Poor, name the specific failing step and which condition it violated (wrong tool, wrong/missing/hallucinated argument, or sequencing); when Good, confirm that all steps passed.
- A correct tool with wrong or hallucinated arguments is still Incorrect.
- A wrong tool that happens to return useful output is still Incorrect.
- A more roundabout tool chosen when a simpler, directly-suited tool was available is Incorrect.

_ACTION_ADVANCEMENT_SYSTEM_TEMPLATE = """You are a goal-advancement evaluator. Given a user message, an assistant response, and optional tool outputs, assign one label for how well the assistant advanced the user's goal.

## Decision Rule
Return exactly one label, deciding in this order:

- "Did Not Advance": The response is factually wrong, off-topic, misleading, or contradicts the tool outputs. Accuracy is the gate — if the response is incorrect or inconsistent with the tools, it does not advance the goal regardless of how helpful it sounds.

- "Advanced": The response is accurate and tool-consistent, AND it directly and usefully moves the user toward completing their goal — a complete answer, a correct action confirmation, or a correct result drawn from the tool outputs.

- "Partially Advanced": The response is accurate but does not fully complete the goal — it gives a correct partial answer, or asks a necessary and useful clarifying question that the goal genuinely depends on.

Key rules:
- Accuracy is checked first. A response that is factually wrong or contradicts the tool outputs is always "Did Not Advance", even if it is on-topic and well-phrased.
- The deciding question between Advanced and Partially Advanced is: does the response fully move the user to their goal? If it completes the goal accurately → Advanced. If it only moves part of the way (partial answer or a necessary clarification) → Partially Advanced.
- A clarifying question is "Partially Advanced" only if it is genuinely necessary to proceed. A clarification the assistant did not actually need is not advancement.
- If tool outputs are provided, the response must faithfully reflect them. Any mismatch is "Did Not Advance".
- Judge advancement of the goal, not length or politeness.
